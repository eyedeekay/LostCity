# LostCity

Scripts that package UnCiv so it will only communicate with I2P Services.
Intended to make it easy to play with https://eyedeekay.github.io/soap/

[This is ENTIRELY a custom package of another piece of software, Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv)
It is re-distributed without any changes to either the license or the source
code, which is available at the above URL. This project is SOLELY a packaging
enterprise, and a very simple one at that. It uses jpackage to bundle Unciv,
set defaults that work with I2P for the jpackaged JVM, then generates platform
specific packages out of the result.

There is virtually no work involved on my part and I deserve absolutely no credit.
But it is kind of fun. :)
