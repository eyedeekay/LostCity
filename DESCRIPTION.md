LostCity Unciv Custom Packages
------------------------------

LostCity is a set of customized packages for the game [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv)
expressly designed to make it playable over I2P Services by default. It is otherwise
an un-altered game of Unciv. It is entirely a packaging effort and is distributed under
the Mozilla Public License that is also used by Unciv.

There is also a self-configuring Unciv multiplayer server which uses I2P, called
[soap](https://github.com/eyedeekay/soap)(because hygiene is necessary for civilization).
You can use it to host multiplayer servers, then connect LostCity clients to them.

Version numbers track the Unciv version they're based on.
